#One-Sample and Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing (t-testing) to test out hypotheses

# Performed one-sample and two-sample t-tests to validate given
hypotheses.
# Concluded and documented the validity of the hypotheses based
on test outcomes.


#R Code:


#One Sample T-test

#Null Hypothesis: The average price of wines from the US is equal to the overall average price of wine
#Alternative Hypothesis:The average price of wines from the US is not equal to the overall average price of wine

# Load the necessary library
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
wine_data<-read.csv("winemag-data.csv file-path")

# Filter out rows with NA prices
wine_data <- wine_data[!is.na(wine_data$price), ]

# Calculate the overall mean price (excluding NAs)
overall_mean <- mean(wine_data$price, na.rm = TRUE)

# Perform the one-sample t-test
t_test_result_one_sample <- t.test(wine_data$price[wine_data$country == "US"], mu = overall_mean)

# Print the result
print(t_test_result_one_sample)




#Two Sample T-test

#Null Hypothesis: The average price of wines from the US is equal to the average price of wines from France.
#Alternative Hypothesis:The average price of wines from the US is not equal to the average price of wines from France.

# Load the necessary library

# Load the dataset
wine_data<-read.csv("/winemag-data.csv file-path")

# Filter out rows with NA prices

# Extract the prices for wines from the US and France
us_prices <- wine_data$price[wine_data$country == "US"]

Output:

1st Output:
data: wine_data$price[wine_data$country == "US"] t = 10.406, df = 54264, p-value < 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 35.36339 95 percent confidence interval: 36.34554 36.80139 sample estimates: mean of x 36.57346


Interpretation:

t=10.406
The t-statistic measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in your sample data. A large t-statistic indicates that the observed difference is not likely due to random chance.


Degrees of Freedom:
df=54264
This is the number of independent values in the data that can vary without violating any statistical constraint. It often relates to the number of observations in your samples.


P-value:
<2.2e−16
The p-value is extremely small (much less than 0.05), which indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. 


95% Confidence Interval:
[36.34554,36.80139]
This means we are 95% confident that the true mean price of wines from the US lies within this interval.
Sample Estimates:
The estimated mean price of wines from the US in your sample is $36.57346, which is higher than the overall average price of $35.36339.

2nd Output:
data: us_prices and france_prices t = -8.0753, df = 19368, p-value = 7.123e-16 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -5.673862 -3.457451 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 36.57346 41.13912 

Interpretation:

T-Statistic:
t=−8.0753
The negative t-statistic indicates that the mean price of wines from the US is lower than the mean price of wines from France in your sample.


Degrees of Freedom:
df=19368
This value relates to the number of independent observations in the two samples.


P-value:
7.123e−16
This extremely small p-value (much less than 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. 


95% Confidence Interval:
[−5.673862,−3.457451]
This interval represents the estimated difference in means between the two groups. We are 95% confident that the average price of wines from the US is between $3.46 and $5.67 less than the average price of wines from France.


Sample Estimates:
The estimated mean price of wines from the US in your sample is $36.57346, while the estimated mean price of wines from France is $41.13912. The difference is consistent with the t-statistic and the confidence interval.
